        Urrmmmm, this is my first React App. Started learning it recently though
        👌👌

        As you can see this contact page displays these dummy texts. Just added
        it so I can learn the React Router kini well(Dynamic Routing inclusive)
        ✌🤞

        I used Styled components for the styling. It's almost the same with CSS.
        🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
      </p>
      <p>
        I almost forgot to say I also used HOOKS(useState, useEffect) I think
        they are so much better than class components. Feels so nice to run away
        from 'this' keyword 😜😜
      </p>
    </ContactPage>
